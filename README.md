# SmartEye Monitor

A simple app that receives gaze data from SmartEye tracker and visualizes focused planes.

May serve as a template for apps that implement logging or interaction functionality.

Note that this project has a dependency on binaries of the [SEClient project](https://github.com/lexasss/se-client).
